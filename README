This script

* synchronizes the files in a local directory with the "Downloads" section of a chosen Github repository
* generates an index.html based on the files in the directory
* commits and pushes the index.html


Limitations:

* Local directory must not contain subdirectories
* Doesn't do any CWD-validation at the moment
